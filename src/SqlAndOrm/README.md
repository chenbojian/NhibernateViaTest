## What is ORM?

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. 

### Pros and Cons

#### Using ORM saves a lot of time because:

- DRY: You write your data model in only one place, and it's easier to update, maintain, and reuse the code.
- A lot of stuff is done automatically, from database handling to I18N.
- It forces you to write MVC code, which, in the end, makes your code a little cleaner.
- You don't have to write poorly-formed SQL (most Web programmers really suck at it, because SQL is treated like a "sub" language, when in reality it's a very powerful and complex one).
- Sanitizing; using prepared statements or transactions are as easy as calling a method.

#### Using an ORM library is more flexible because:

- It fits in your natural way of coding (it's your language!).
- It abstracts the DB system, so you can change it whenever you want.
- The model is weakly bound to the rest of the application, so you can change it or use it anywhere else.
- It lets you use OOP goodness like data inheritance without a headache.

#### But ORM can be a pain:

- You have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not lightweight tools;
- You have to set it up. Same problem.
- Performance is OK for usual queries, but a SQL master will always do better with his own SQL for big projects.
- It abstracts the DB. While it's OK if you know what's happening behind the scene, it's a trap for new programmers that can write very greedy statements, like a heavy hit in a for loop.


### Tasks

#### ADO.NET

- Implement the repository with sql.

#### FluentNhibernate

- Install FluentNhibernate.
- Implement the repository with FluentNhibernate.

#### Compare

- Use different way to implement the feature: find the person whose name have 'zhang'.
